# SQLcl - Scripting
Learn how to create custom scripts for SQLcl.

SQLcl allows you to execute scripts. The main reason is to extend its functionality and automate your tasks as developer. This way you can interact with both the Database and local files (such as Database Objects and SQL scripts)

You can use scripts in two ways:
1. Via the ```script``` command
2. Inside an ```alias```

This project shows you 
- a way to test your SQLcl scripts in Netbeans IDE
- Lots of examples

# Testing scripts with Netbeans IDE

## Basic Nashorn scripts
In this section is you'll learn the basics of writing Nashorn scripts.
